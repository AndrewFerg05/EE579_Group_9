### Project Outline:
The objective of this project is to retrofit an RC car to make it self-driving. The car will then play a game of skittles. Specifically:
- The car will **sense and knock over black skittles**.  
- The car will **avoid the white skittle** to ensure accuracy in gameplay.

### Directory Structure:
#### 1. **Source Code**  
   - Contains main program files and library files for the project.

#### 2. **Test Files**  
   - Contains Arduino test projects for specific elements of the system.  
   - **Note**: The `EE579_Group_Library` folder from the source code must be copied into the Arduino library directory to run the test files correctly.
